[1] wtf

Strangely, Ubuntu for WSL requires coordination with snap to install packages from the apt package manager. Ubuntu is probably not a serious enough distribution to avoid weekly hijinx (but the studio-audience loves it ðŸ˜©).

As answered in from [How do I install Firefox in WSL, when it requires snap, but snap doesn't work?](https://askubuntu.com/a/1444967/1308115)

sudo snap remove firefox
sudo apt remove firefox
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa

-- /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozillateamppa --
Package: firefox*
Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam
Pin-Priority: 501

sudo apt update
sudo apt install firefox # or firefox-esr
